# ceu_spreadsheets
A small compendium of spreadsheets designed to help you progress in Nomifactory CEu (latest config: 1.5.1)

Current WIP spreadsheets:
1. A spreadsheet for optimising petrochem and pyrolysis processing for polymers (polyethylene, polyvinyl chloride, etc) and circuit boards (with a comparison of single-block vs multiblock reactors)
2. A spreadsheet for optimising element generation, including progression (for example, hydrogen generation)

Current to-do list:
1. Create Google Sheets versions of the spreadsheets for wider accessibility
